#  Cyber Security Course Volume 1
## Know Yourself - The Threat and Vulnerability Landscape

**Security** = way to protect your assets.

**Assets** = what is important and have to be secured.

* What is most confidential?
* What can't you afford to lose?
* What is irreplaceable?
* What would cause the most damage?
* What might impact your reputation?

**Privacy** = no one knows what you do, but can know who you are. Privacy is about content, secret content.

**Anonymity** = no one knows who you are, but can know what you do. Anonymity keeps your actions separate from your true identity.

**Pseudonymity** = you get a reputation from what you do, but it's has nothing to do with the real you.

Apply security controls to your assets to protect them from threats planned and executed by attackers. The threats try to exploit vulnerabilities in the security to get access to the assets.

**Risk** = Vulnerability X Threats X Consequences

**Threat Landscape or Model** = attackers and threats that are faced.

**Risk Assessments** = select the right security for specific assets.

Select, implement, assess and monitor the security controls for assets.

### CIA Triad

**Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability**

The security controls need to enable the security attributes (CIA Triad).

### Defense In Depth

**Prevent**: encryption.
**Detect**: setup a canary.
**Recover**: backup.

### ZERO Trust Model

Evaluate instead of trust. Mitigate the risk. Trust nothing.

Crypton and Encryptr are Zero Knowledge systems, they don't know what the clients are hosting.

## Know Your Enemy  - The Current Threat and Vulnerability Landscape

**Vulnerability or Bugs** = error in the software that creates a potential for a hacker to exploit it.

**Known bugs** have patches. Unknown bugs or **Zero Days** don't.

### Hackers

**Malware** = all programs written with malicious intent

Virus, worms, rootkits, trojans, ransomware, RATs, spywares, adware, scareware, browser hijacking are types of malware.

**Phishing** = attack that tricks the victim into clicking on a link, filling a form with personal details or executing something unwanted.

**Doxing** = research on an individual, organization or company top find personal or private information. It can be done by searching on the internet.

**Scams or Social Engineering Attacks** = attacks that central weaknesses in the human. Ex: fake emails saying that your bank account needs your documents; buying something and don't receive it; 

**CPU Hijackers** = malware that hijacks your CPU cycles to mine cryptocurrency.

**Darkweb** = any encrypted overlay network that can only be accessed with specific types of software, authorization, protocols or ports.

To protect against known vulnerabilities and bugs is to use **formal methods**. The software is fundamentally a mathematical system, therefore you can prove the correctness of a system by testing the properties of that system. This way you can provide complete evidence of correctness.

**Back Door** = weakness of a system.
